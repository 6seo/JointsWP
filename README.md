Currently using Foundation 6.3

This is the development branch of JointsWP 5. This is not meant for production at this time. Be sure to check out the rest of the README for install instructions.

### JointsWP Requirements
JointsWP requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v4.x.x or v6.9.x. This doesn't mean you need to understand Node (or even Gulp) - it's just the steps we need to take to make sure all of our development tools are installed. 

### Getting Started 
#### Download JointsWP and install dependencies with npm 
```bash
$ cd my-wordpress-folder/wp-content/themes/
$ git clone https://github.com/jeremyenglert/JointsWP.git
$ cd JointsWP
$ npm install
```
At this point, JointsWP should be installed and fully running on your local machine.
